The cost to become a member of a fitness center is as follows: 
(a) Senior citizens discount is 30%, 
(b) If membership is bought and paid for 12 or more months, the discount is 15%, 
(c) If more than five personal training sessions are bought and paid for, the discount on each session is 20%.
Write a menu-driven program that determines the cost of a new membership.
Your program must contain a function that displays the general information
about the fitness center and its charges; a function to get all of the necessary
information to determine the membership cost; and a function to determine
the membership cost.
