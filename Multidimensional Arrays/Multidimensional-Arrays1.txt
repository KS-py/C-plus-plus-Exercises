a. Write the definition of the function setZero that initializes any onedimensional array of type int to 0.

b. Write the definition of the function inputArray that prompts the user
to input 20 numbers and stores the numbers into alpha.

c. Write the definition of the function doubleArray that initializes the elements of beta to two times the corresponding elements in alpha. Make
sure that you prevent the function from modifying the elements of alpha.

d. Write the definition of the function copyGamma that sets the elements
of the first row of inStock to gamma and the remaining rows of inStock to three times the previous row of inStock. Make sure that
you prevent the function from modifying the elements of gamma.

e. Write the definition of the function copyAlphaBeta that stores alpha
into the first five rows of inStock and beta into the last five rows of
inStock. Make sure that you prevent the function from modifying the
elements of alpha and beta.

f. Write the definition of the function printArray that prints any onedimensional array of type int. Print 15 elements per line.

g. Write the definition of the function setInStock that prompts the user
to input the elements for the first column of inStock. The function should then set the elements in the remaining columns to two times the
corresponding element in the previous column, minus the corresponding element in delta.
h. Write C++ statements that call each of the functions in parts a through g.

i. Write a C++ program that tests the function main and the functions
discussed in parts a through g. (Add additional functions, such as printing a two-dimensional array, as needed.)

b) 20 RANDOM NUMBERS (IN case you're tired to type them all out :) ):
