Write a program that reads in a line consisting of a studentâ€™s name, Social
Security number, user ID, and password. The program outputs the string in
which all the digits of the Social Security number, and all the characters in
the password are replaced by x. (The Social Security number is in the form
000-00-0000, and the user ID and the password do not contain any
spaces.) Your program should not use the operator [] to access a string
element
