You are given a file consisting of students’ names in the following form:
lastName, firstName middleName. (Note that a student may not have a middle name.) 
Write a program that converts each name to the following form: firstName middleName lastName. 
Your program must read each student’s entire name in a variable and must consist of a function that takes as input a string,
consists of a student’s name, and returns the string consisting of the altered name.
Use the string function find to find the index of ,; the function length to find the length of the string;
and the function substr to extract the firstName, middleName, and lastName


Please remember to create a `data.txt` file with a few lines of the ff content:
lastName, firstName middleName
